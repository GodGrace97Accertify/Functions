        "\n",
        "Function:\n",
        "\n",
        "A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.\n",
        "It is defined using the def keyword.\n",
        "It can be called independently.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "def greet(name):\n",
        "  print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "greet(\"World\")  # Calling the function\n",
        "Use code with caution\n",
        "Method:\n",
        "\n",
        "A method is also a block of code that performs a specific task, but it is associated with an object.\n",
        "It is defined within a class.\n",
        "It is called on an object of the class.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog:\n",

        "my_dog = Dog()  # Creating an object of the class\n",
        "my_dog.bark()  # Calling the method on the object\n",
        "Use code with caution\n",
        "Key Differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "Association: Functions are independent, while methods are associated with objects/classes.\n",
        "Calling: Functions are called directly, while methods are called on objects using the dot operator.\n",
        "self parameter: Methods have a self parameter that refers to the object the method is called on. Functions do not have this parameter.\n",
        "In simpler terms:\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of a function as a standalone tool, like a hammer. You can use it anywhere, anytime.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of a method as a tool that is part of a larger object, like a button on a remote control. You need the remote control (the object) to use the button (the method).\n",

        "\n",
        "Parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Parameters are the names listed in the function definition that act as placeholders for the values you want to pass to the function. They are defined inside the parentheses () of the function definition.\n",
        "Purpose: To specify what kind of information a function needs to work with.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "def greet(name, age): # name and age are parameters\n",
        "    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n",
        "Use code with caution\n",
        "Arguments:\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Arguments are the actual values that you provide to the function when you call it. These values replace the parameter placeholders.\n",
        "Purpose: To supply the specific information for the function to operate on.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "greet(\"Alice\", 30)  # \"Alice\" and 30 are arguments\n",
        "Use code with caution\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "\n",
        "name and age are the parameters of the greet function.\n",
        "\"Alice\" and 30 are the arguments passed to the function.\n",
        "Types of Arguments:\n",
        "\n",
        "Positional Arguments: Arguments passed based on their position (order) in the function call. They must be provided in the same order as defined in the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Keyword Arguments: Arguments passed using the parameter name followed by an equals sign and the value (e.g., name=\"Alice\"). Order doesn't matter with keyword arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Default Arguments: Parameters can have default values assigned in the function definition. If an argument isn't provided for that parameter, the default value is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "def greet(name=\"User\", age=0):\n",
        "    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n",

        "function_name: The name you give to your function.\n",
        "parameters: The input values (placeholders) the function accepts.\n",
        "Docstring: A brief description of the function (optional but recommended).\n",
        "return value: The value the function sends back after execution (optional).\n",
        "Calling a Function:\n",
        "\n",
        "Directly by name:\n",
        "\n",
        "function_name(arguments)\n",
        "Use code with caution\n",
        "Using a variable: If you've assigned a function to a variable, you can call it using the variable name.\n",
        "\n",
        "my_function = function_name\n",
        "   my_function(arguments)\n",
        "Use code with caution\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "def add(x, y):  # Defining the function\n",
        "    \"\"\"Adds two numbers and returns the sum.\"\"\"\n",
        "    return x + y\n",
        "\n",
        "result = add(5, 3)  # Calling the function and storing the result\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
        "Use code with caution\n",
        "Other Ways to Call Functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "Inside other functions: Functions can be nested and called within each other.\n",
        "As arguments to other functions: Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.\n",
        "Using function objects: You can use function objects with methods like __call__().\n",
        "Important Considerations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Function Scope: Variables defined inside a function are local to that function (function scope).\n",
        "Return Values: The return statement sends a value back from the function. If there's no return, the function returns None.\n",
        "Example with Default Parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "def greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n",
        "  print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",

        "4) What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans ) the purpose of the return statement in a Python function:\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose of the return Statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "Ending Function Execution: The primary purpose of return is to signal the end of a function's execution. When the interpreter encounters a return statement, it immediately stops the execution of the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Returning a Value: return is used to send a value back from the function to the place where it was called. This value can be of any data type (integer, string, list, etc.) or even another function.\n",
        "\n",
        "How return Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "When a function is called, it performs its tasks.\n",
        "If there's a return statement, the function stops, and the specified value (after return) is sent back to the caller.\n",
        "If there's no return statement or if it's just return without a value, the function implicitly returns None.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "def add(x, y):\n",
        "  \"\"\"This function adds two numbers and returns the sum.\"\"\"\n",
        "  sum = x + y\n",
        "  return sum  # Returning the calculated sum\n",
        "\n",
        "result = add(5, 3)  # Calling the function and storing the returned value\n",
        "print(result)       # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "\n",
        "The add function calculates the sum of x and y.\n",
        "The return sum statement sends the calculated sum back to where the function was called.\n",
        "The returned value is then stored in the result variable and printed.\n",
        "Why return is Important:\n",
        "\n",
        "Getting Results: return allows you to get the results of computations or operations performed inside a function. Without it, you wouldn't be able to access the data processed by the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reusability: Functions with return values can be used as building blocks for more complex logic. You can reuse the returned values in other parts of your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modularity: return helps in breaking down problems into smaller, manageable functions, which improves code organization and readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans iterators and iterables in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterables:\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: An iterable is any Python object that can be looped over using a for loop. It has a method called __iter__() that returns an iterator.\n",
        "Examples: Lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, sets, files, and generators are all iterables.\n",
        "Key Point: You can iterate over the elements of an iterable directly.\n",
        "Iterators:\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: An iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which consists of two methods: __iter__() and __next__().\n",
        "__iter__(): Returns the iterator object itself.\n",
        "__next__(): Returns the next item in the sequence. When there are no more items, it raises a StopIteration exception.\n",
        "Key Point: An iterator is used to fetch elements from an iterable one at a time.\n",
        "Difference between Iterables and Iterators:\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterables are objects you can loop over, while iterators are objects that do the looping.\n",
        "You can get an iterator from an iterable using the iter() function.\n",
        "Once you've consumed all the elements of an iterator, you can't iterate over it again. You would need to create a new iterator from the iterable.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # my_list is an iterable\n",
        "my_iterator = iter(my_list)  # my_iterator is an iterator\n",
        "\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 1\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 2\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 3\n",
        "# print(next(my_iterator))  # Raises StopIteration exception\n",
        "Use code with caution\n",
        "Why Use Iterators:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: Iterators only compute the next value when it's needed, saving memory and improving efficiency.\n",
        "Stateful Iteration: They keep track of their current position, allowing you to resume iteration from where you left off.\n",
        "Customization: You can create your own iterators for specific data structures or algorithms.\n",
        "In essence:\n",
        "\n",
        "An iterable is a container that holds data you want to loop through.\n",
        "An iterator is a special object that lets you access the data from the iterable one item at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans ) What are Generators?\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are a special type of iterator that can be used to produce a sequence of values lazily. This means that instead of calculating and storing all the values in memory at once, a generator computes and yields each value one at a time when it's requested.\n",
        "\n",
        "Defining Generators:\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two primary ways to define generators in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generator Functions: These are functions that use the yield keyword instead of return. When a generator function is called, it doesn't execute the code immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object. Each time the next() function is called on the generator object, the function body is executed until a yield statement is encountered. The value specified after yield is returned, and the function's state is saved. This process continues until the function completes or encounters a return statement (which signals the end of the sequence).\n",
        "\n",
        "def my_generator(n):\n",
        "       for i in range(n):\n",

        "   print(next(gen))  # Output: 2\n",
        "   # print(next(gen))  # Raises StopIteration\n",
        "Use code with caution\n",
        "Generator Expressions: These are concise ways to create generators using a syntax similar to list comprehensions, but with parentheses () instead of square brackets []. Generator expressions are useful for simple generators that can be defined in a single line.\n",

        "   print(next(gen))  # Output: 2\n",
        "Use code with caution\n",
        "Benefits of Using Generators:\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory Efficiency: Generators produce values on demand, reducing memory usage compared to storing entire sequences in memory.\n",
        "Improved Performance: Lazy evaluation can lead to faster execution, especially for large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "Readability and Elegance: Generators can make code more concise and easier to understand.\n",
        "Pipeline Processing: Generators can be chained together to create data processing pipelines.\n",
        "Use Cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are suitable for scenarios where you need to:\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterate over large datasets without loading them entirely into memory.\n",
